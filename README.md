### It’s-a Me, Mario! 🏃🏻‍♂️ 

I fell in love with computers through videogames 👾 when I was really young but I ended up restarting Kubernetes pods ***professionally***.

Computer engineer specialised in Infrastructure as Code and DevOps practices/tools 🛠. 

Currently building (and maintaining 😅) the future of supermarkets at AiFi 🛒 while enjoying remote life 🇪🇸🇵🇹🇲🇦🇨🇻🇲🇾🇮🇩🇹🇭.

Super-dooper into:
- losing money in the stock/crypto market 📉
- taking photos I never upload to any platform 📸
- thinking that I am a better cook than I truly am 👩🏻‍🍳
